    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 1, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for playing <strong>Princeps</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal information when you use our mobile game.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal data from users directly.</p>
    <p>However, our game uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. Specifically:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>AdMob by Google</strong><br>
        We use AdMob to serve ads within our game. AdMob may collect and use certain data as described in their own privacy policies, such as device identifiers, IP address, and information about your interactions with ads.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For more information, please refer to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google’s Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additionally, platform providers like Apple and Google may collect data as part of their standard app store operations and analytics. We do not have access to or control over this data.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not use, store, or share any personal information about you. Any data collected through third-party services like AdMob is managed under their respective privacy policies and terms of service.</p>

    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our game is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to remove that information.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. Data collected through third-party services (e.g., AdMob) is subject to their own data processing and sharing practices.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using our game, you consent to this privacy policy and the collection and use of information as outlined above.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
